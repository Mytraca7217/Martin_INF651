*** FINAL PROJECT: FALLOUT STYLE RETRO TERMINAL INTERFACE ***

This is a retro style terminal interface inspired by the Fallout game franchise. To use it, open the index.html file in a web browser. 
You will be prompted to create a username, hit the confirm button and you will be greeated with a custom welcome message. Your username will also be updated in the footer section of the page for the duration of your session. 

You can then use the navigation buttons on the top of the page to naviage through the other two pages, the "about" and "logs" pages. 
On the "About" page, you can click on a button to show vault information or a button to show system diagnostics. These will print to the screen. If you click the same button more than once a message will appear letting you know
that the information requested is already being displayed. This will reset if you click off of the "about" page and then back on. You will then be able to hit the buttons again to get an output on the terminal screen. 

The logs page consists of three pre-written logs and a form that can be used to create new logs. 
The user will need to enter a title, a date (will auto-select todays date if no date selected manually), and enter text for the log to be successfully written to the terminal. 
All logs written during the session will remain present until the session has ended.
